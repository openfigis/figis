Load /jmeter/figis-jmeter.jmx in Jmeter
Run the batch
Save results in csv
Exclude the URL which were giving an error
Remove ;jsessionid= from URLS
Load urls in FireFix Flem
Record the requests in Jmeter



Conclusion
Cleaning the requests does not make much sense because certain requests cause always again new requests and they maybe wrong.
