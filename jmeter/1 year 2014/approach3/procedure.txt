So it makes not sense to filter out the errors. So back to the original /jmeter/monitor.csv
We run the test with that one. Export them in Excel, filter out the errors and AVG the results

It also makes sense to do faulty requests because that is done also in reality. The only thing what could be done is to delete the 
session ids. There are 56 matches for ;jsessionid= 

Results with session id
Samples 934, AVG 84, ERROR 38%

Results without session id
Samples 934, AVG 95, ERROR 38%

This means that it does not make significant difference to add or to remove session id.
