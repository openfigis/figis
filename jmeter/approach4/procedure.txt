Chaning the HTTP Request defaults from production to development.

I decided not to care about the faulty results. They can be filtered out. 

The tests take a long time. That is why I decided to specify the timeouts on the HTTP Request defaults on 5000ms. 
Then also 5s took toom much time, now on 1 s.
