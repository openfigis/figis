SQParams is a set of parameters for StatQuery engine. 
These parameters define a query, and are sufficient 
for running SQProcessor.
They do not include SQServlet parameters such as paging, table processing options, etc.

Note: 
Names of datasets, Series and Keys must be spelled 
the same as in StatQuery.xml file.
(found under server's figis/properties/ directory, e.g.//figis01/iis4root/tomcat-devel/figis/properties)
Consult this file when unsure.
-->

<!--SQParams is a root element. -->
<!ELEMENT SQParams (Series | SQKeyParams | Year | CalcCol)*>


<!ATTLIST SQParams
  DatasetName CDATA #REQUIRED
  ShowUnits (0 | 1) "1"
  ShowFlags (0 | 1) "1"
>
<!-- DatasetName should be spelled the same as in StatQuery.xml file.
Convention is first letter capital, all others small.
At the time of writing the following datasets were active 
(correct spelling here!):
		Capture
		Aquaculture
		Production
		Fleet
		Trade
		TunaLandings
		TunaAtlas		
-->

<!-- ShowUnits says whether query engine should extract 
units from the database.
Note: setting ShowUnits to 0 may potentially lead to 
the wrong results	if dataset contains multiple units. 
However, if you are sure that your query returns one unit,
you can set ShowUnits to "0"
-->

<!-- ShowFlags says whether to extract symbols (. F -, etc). 
Some queries execute faster when ShowFlags is set to 0
 -->

<!-- A series to include. Series are also called parameters 
and variables. For example, Quantity and Value in aquaculture.
Series names must be spelled exactly as in StatQuery.xml 
(usually all uppercase):
   For Aquaculture  QUANTITY, VALUE
   For Capture      QUANTITY
   For Production   QUANTITY
   For Fleet        NUMBER, TONNAGE
   For Trade        QUANTITY, VALUE
   For TunaAtlas    QUANTITY
   For TunaLandings QUANTITY

If Series element is omitted, all series are extracted
-->
<!ELEMENT Series (#PCDATA)>

<!-- Years to include. Each element should contain 
one year. For annual datasets, years are shown as 4-digit numbers.

For quarterly datasets (TunaAtlas), years should be in format
yyyy-Qn, where n=1..4 or X. For instance, 1999-Q4 or 1999-QX.

TunaAtlas also allows to specify years (1999) that are converted
to calculated columns (Sum(1999-Q1,1999-Q2,1999-Q3,1999-Q4,1999-QX)
-->
<!ELEMENT Year (#PCDATA)>

<!-- Calculated columns to include
They must be in format

function_name(year,year,year...)
or
column_name=function_name(year,year,year)

Supported functions are SUM and AVG (must be written in capitals)
-->
<!ELEMENT CalcCol (#PCDATA)>


<!--
Keys to extract. Order of the keys is significant: 
The first SQKeyParams ends up the first column in the result,
the first sort criterion, etc.

<!-- KeyName should be defined in StatQuery.XML. 
Usually spelled in all capitals
Known keys are 
   For Aquaculture  SPECIES,COUNTRY,OCEAN_AREA,ENVIRONMENT
   For Capture      SPECIES,COUNTRY,OCEAN_AREA
   For Production   SPECIES,COUNTRY,OCEAN_AREA
   For Fleet        VESSELCLASS,COUNTRY,VESSELTYPE
   For Trade        COMMODITY,COUNTRY,TRADEFLOW
   For TunaAtlas    OCEAN_AREA,SPECIES,GEAR
   For TunaLandings STOCK,COUNTRY,GEAR
-->

<!-- MetaID is optional. It is a filter for ALL keys
(not your selection). There is no need to specify it
except for very special cases
 -->
<!-- HierID is hierarchy ID as defined by RefService.
HierID=0 means "flat key" (do not build trees)
which is appropriate for many cases. Use non-zero Hierarchies
if you need grouping and group totals. Some hierarchies:
  for COUNTRY - 
		10002	Continents
		10003	Continents and regions
		10004	Economic groups
  for OCEAN_AREA - 
		20002	Area by ocean
		20001	Area by subocean
		23002	5 degree squares by area20002 (by ocean)
	for SPECIES - 
		30001	Major group
		30002	ISSCAAP group
		30003	FAOSTAT group
		30004	Ybk main groups
		30005	Taxonomic
	for VESSELCLASS -
		62001	GRT class hierarchy
	for VESSELTYPE			
		64204   ISSCFV(old)
	for COMMODITY
		40001	Harmonized
		40005	ICS classification
		40006	SITC classification
	for STOCK
		94002	Stocks by species
		94003	Stocks by area
 -->

<!-- 
Visible attribute of a key says whether the key must appear in the results. If Visible=0, key is used only for filtering.
(therefore Visible=0 makes sense only if selection is specified)
-->

<!-- 
DisplayAttr says which attributes of the key to display
It only makes sense with Visible=1.
Default is name in current language.
Attribute IDs must be valid meta attributes as 
defined in Reference services.
Two notations are allowed:
n - attribute ID
n:lang - attribute ID and language (language must be en|fr|es)

For instance,
1 - name in current language
1:fr - french name
12 - species scientific name

There may be many attributes for each key. They become 
separate columns in the output. Sort order is defined by 
the first attribute
-->
<!ELEMENT DisplayAttr (#PCDATA)>

<!-- Key selection -->
<!ELEMENT Selection (ID | Query)+>
<!-- Individual integer ID. May be ID for a key or for a group
Group ID means "get total for this group", it does not
mean "get details for all members"
-->
<!ELEMENT ID (#PCDATA)>

<!-- 
List of IDs extracted from a URL. URL should return well-formed XML
containing elements <ID></ID> containing integer numbers.
Any other input is ignored.

URL can be either absolute, or relative to the servlet root, e.g.
if you specify
myservlet?idlist=a,
and application is running on figis01:8080
this will be extended into
http://figis01:8080/fiservlet/myservlet?idlist=a

RefObjectServlet is able to generate lists of IDs. At the 
moment there are two useful commands:

- org.fao.fi.figis.reftable.RefObjectServlet?metaID=<meta>
  gets all objects of a given type, e.g. 32002 to get 
  all ISSCAAP divisions
-  org.fao.fi.figis.reftable.RefObjectServlet?
		metaID=<meta>&cmd=related&rel=<rel>&related=<relatedID>
	gets all objects of type <meta> related with relationship <rel>
	to <relatedID> (e.g. all objects in a group). E.g.
	metaID=31102&cmd=related&rel=32001&related=1401 -
	all aquaculture species (31102) in ISSCAAP group (32001)
	"Carps" (1401)
	
There's an entity ObjServlet to simplify queries
